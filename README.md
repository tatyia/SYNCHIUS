# SYNCHIUS
Anki Card sharing hub (for use with raspberry pi)

This server and client Python code were created to facilitate note sharing between students. 
e.g. someone finds a useful tidbit about a topic and adds it to a field in the anki cards. 
They can then upload their cards to the server and everyone else can download the modifications. 
This code will allow you and your friends using this server to share each otherâ€™s modifications made to anki cards.
